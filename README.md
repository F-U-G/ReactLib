# React Lib

My personal web dev component lib written in React/Typescript, also uses Tailwindcss.

## Components
- [x] App.tsx(handle component structure and navigation)
    - [x] Page nav switch
- [x] Navbar
- [x] Footer
- [x] Hero section 
- [ ] Email From
- [ ] Light/dark theme toggle
    - this one might be harder with tailwindcss, might need to be javascript
    conditional rendering and change the color palette for all components somehow
- [x] Info card(for example, cards that each represent a service offered)
- [ ] Video item
- [ ] Image background item
- [ ] Calendar
- [ ] Sign up/sign in, profiles, etc
